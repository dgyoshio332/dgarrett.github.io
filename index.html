              <span class="overlay-text">This was a social media post for a student-run magazine, in which the social media team formulated a calling-out to regular members to try and take the place of leaders who will soon graduate. I was able to go through multiple iterations, and one of them was this, created through Adobe Photoshop. It utilized a mix of illustrative and design elements.

              <span class="overlay-text">This was a mock poster I made for a final in a design/vis arts class, promoting an art show, which was thought up through multiple brainstorming exercises over the course of the class. I used both Figma, Photoshop, and multiple physical models to brainstorm the final look of the poster, experiementing with typography and its relationship to abstract ideas, as well as shapes.

              <span class="overlay-text">This was another iteration of the call-to-action for newer members of Other People Magazine to become leaders of the group. here I once again played around with my illustrative skills, and combined that with the graphic elements that the team asked me to include. This was all done through Photoshop.

              <span class="overlay-text">Leaning more heavily towards the graphic design side, I was tasked with creating a coninuous instagram post where the slides looked seemless. A warm, autumn gradient was placed within the template, and I started to think about the shape of Other People's logo and how I could play with it to create an interesting atmospheric, ambient feel to the post.

              <h4 class="project_title">CSU Curriculum Graphic</h4>
              <span class="overlay-text">This was a graphical pieace done for the CSU Chancellor's Office, in which I was asked to create some sort of "pathway of success." And so, I decided that a student's journey through his/her curriculum should be an elegant one, and with the help of my client, we came up with this very tranquil, weightless flowing form, accompanied by weightless text, to represent the great journery that students had ahead of themselves in the CSU system. I played around a lot with different brushes in Photoshop, and this indeed was a piece with a lot of trial-and-error.

And so, they chose me to design their logo and other promotional materials for them. This involved a lot of thinking about how to incoporate the sunflower, with the idea of sustainability, mother nature, green, etc. (trying to combine all these natural ideas into one conceptual imade).

It was supposed to represent the feeling of absorbing how other people think of you and feel about you, and taking that to heart, being paranoid about it. This included experiemnetation with geometric shapes and color shifts, I had been limited materially, forcing me to play with the purely visual factors of the drawing?

We had to combine multiple different materials and mediums, while still having a consistent theme. One thing I played around a lot with in this one, was yellow tape and how that could interplay with other vibrant paints and color pencils. it was quite a large piece as well so it took a lot of planning and time, depsite how chaotic it is.

              <span class="overlay-text">I wanted to convey the form of a fruit salad, through the experiemnting of the human form. It was done with water color and done on card stock. I especially played a lot with the dismemberment of form, while also still maintaining a connection beteen the bodies. perspective was certainly the hardest thing to get down though, however, I had a lot of fun.

              <span class="overlay-text">A study of skateboarding and surf culture, mixed with the neon, cyberpunk aesthetic of Tokyo. This was done in photoshop, and I played around a lot with the different color layers and blend modes, to give off this thermal look to the scene. It was also a new perspective of the human form which I had never explored before.

              <span class="overlay-text">A personal piece I had made, in which I had felt extremely tired, and I felt like my fingers were going to fall of. The main challenge with this piece was the choice of color. Although photoshop provides you with a lot options, it is hard to pick what the best combination of tones and colors fits the composition and the subject. I also wanted it to reflect my mood, and so I went with a cool, moody purple.

              <h4 class="project_title">Head Bandits</h4>
              <span class="overlay-text">A break-dance inspired piece, interspersed with Oni heads. It was a conceptual piece combining Japanese culture and hip-hop culture, which I think have a lot to offer in the way of forms and shapes and movement. The movement was the biggest challenge with this one--trying to figure out what position would look best next to this one, and how this limb should go this way to prevent the piece from looking static.

              <h4 class="project_title">Mushroom Head</h4>
              <span class="overlay-text">This was a final piece for my visarts sculptural class, where I had to create a sculpture based on time and the changing of things. I decide to go with fungi and decay, which felt like a natural gateway into exploring tribal aesthetics. Plaster, real dirt and grass, clay, and all the above were used for this project, and it was certainly one of the most challenging in my life. Pieces did fall apart, but I found that eventually they were able to lean onto each other and gel together the longer I let the sculpture be. It was almost like it was living.

              <span class="overlay-text">A collaborative piece with a photographer friend of mine, where I was tasked with creating a layer to emerse the photograph into a natural environment/setting. It was heavily inspired by the manga Vagabond. With this piece, i had to work a lot with silhouettes and shadow, as well as negative space, as I had to draw around the subject of the photo rather than on him.

              <span class="overlay-text">It was the same case with the previous one, however this one was inspired by the credits of 60s Japanese Samurai movies. It was done in a very calligraphic way, and it was interesting to look at how you could make something so culturally and artisitically important and grounded in the hitsory of a people, and recreate it artificially through a screen.

        <p>About Me</p>
        <img src="images/Self-Portrait.jpg" id="logo-image" width="600" height="700" alt="Selfie">
        <p>A multiracial artist and designe--I like to explore and experiement with all types of mediums, but feel most
          comfortable with the traditional pens and markers, as well as the digital side of illustration and design.
          Both mediums have lead me to more exploratory and analytical ways of thinking and perceiving visually, opening
          up my abilities to represent an idea or a concept through aestehtic means. My art and design is largely
          informed by Japanese culture and tradition, the human form, and the stylistic patterns of surrealism and
          cartoons. In any medium I work with however, I look for the most visually-captivating way to represent an
          important idea or concept, that I feel could elicit any sort of emotional response. I want an emotional or
          physical reaction, a reflection, or even a subconcious action.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of experience in volunteering my talents towards other creatives and organizations, however I am
          continuing on a path to learning more from veterans in the field to gain more professional experience.</p>
        <p>Current Speculative Design major and Design minor undergraduate student (2025) at UC San Diego.</p>
